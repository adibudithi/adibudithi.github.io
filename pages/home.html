            Hello! I'm a software engineer living in Brooklyn, New York. I'm into food, fitness,
            friends, basketball, and video games. I'm working on some
            personal projects and learning about algorithms, networking, data science, and
            machine learning. I got my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science
            at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and have over 3 years of
            programming experience with companies like Capital One and AbbVie.

        <p>Wow.</p>
        <p>
            This NBA season's already been wild. Everyone's going hard on the playoffs but Jimmy
            Butler is different. Bucks were my favorite cuz I love Giannis but let's see who
            wants it more.

        <p>Going 24.</p>
        <p>
            Man, I'm old. Feeling tired and still dumb. What does it take to grow up? Anyways, nursed
            my boy Matt while he's sick and watched him play both The Last of Us games cuz of the
            show hype. Honestly, a pretty good day.

        <img src="/images/blog/me-and-wasan.jpg" alt="blog image" />
        <p>Started lifting again...</p>
        <p>
            Time to get back into it. I'm focusing on more bodyweight/calisthenic/flexibility work
            for joint health and overall strength. Cardio will come in time.

        <p>Well then.</p>
        <p>
            Sometimes, you gotta take one step back to take two steps forward. I enjoyed my time
            there and learned a bunch, gonna miss you folks.
