            <p>Wow.</p>
            <p>
                This NBA season's already been wild. Everyone's going hard on the playoffs but Jimmy
                Butler is different. Bucks were my favorite cuz I love Giannis but let's see who
                wants it more.

            <p>
                Man, I'm old. Feeling tired and still dumb. What does it take to grow up? Anyways, nursed
                my boy Matt while he's sick and watched him play both The Last of Us games cuz of the
                show hype. Honestly, a pretty good day.

            <p>Started lifting again...</p>
            <p>
                Time to get back into it. I'm focusing on more bodyweight/calisthenic/flexibility work
                for joint health and overall strength. Cardio will come in time.
